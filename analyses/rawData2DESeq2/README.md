# RNA-seq data processing using DESeq2
- `DESeq2_pairwise_comparison`: The initial pairwise comparison analyses using DESeq2, the venn diagram, gene set overlap anlaysis and GSEA were performed on the initial analyses
- `DESeq2_four_groups`: The subsequent analyses were performed to facility LRT test, heatmap plotting for all four groups and statistical test with interaction term.
  - `full_table` is generated from the subsequent analyses.
- `preranked_gene_list`: include all the preranked gene lists used for all GSEA analyses.
